#Simple Model

First we fit our most simple model, which includes the binary variables of health insurance and race, adjusting for age and marital status.
```{r logistic-regression-simple-model}
set.seed(84735)
morbidity_simple_model <- stan_glm(
  no_mmorb ~ race + insurance + age + marital, 
  data = morbidity_binary_data, family = binomial,
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2)
```

Next, we wanted to summarize our model.
```{r simple-model-summary}
simple_model_summary <- summary(morbidity_simple_model)
head(as.data.frame(simple_model_summary),-2)
```

```{r simple-model-odds}
#means
exp(0.36729956) #race
exp(-0.71808914) #insurance
```

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, the odds that a non-white person does not experience maternal morbidity is an average of 1.44 times the odds that a white person does not experience morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and race, the odds that someone with insurance does not experience maternal morbidity is an average of 0.487 times the odds that someone without insurance does not experience morbidity.

```{r simple-model-intervals}
#credible intervals
exp(c(0.06499287	, 0.67682544)) #race
exp(c(-1.55097967, 0.04133771)) #insurance
```

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, there is an 80% posterior probability that the odds that a non-white person does not experience maternal morbidity is between 1.06 and 1.96 times the odds that a white person does not experience morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, there is an 80% posterior probability that the odds that someone who has insurance does not experience maternal morbidity is between 0.21 and 1.04 times the odds that someone who does not have insurance does not experience morbidity.

```{r simple-model-dens}
#density and trace plots of simple model
mcmc_dens(morbidity_simple_model)
mcmc_trace(morbidity_simple_model)
```

#Complicated Model

We will not interpret the results but just use this to perform comparison tests to see if this is  better than the simple model. If it's better then we could interpret. 

Slightly more complicated model with interaction term between binary variables of race and insurance. 
```{r complicated-model}
set.seed(84735)
complicated_morbidity_model <- stan_glm(
  no_mmorb ~ race + insurance + age + marital + race*insurance, 
  data = morbidity_binary_data, family = binomial,
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2)
```

Summary of interaction model. 
```{r complicated-model-summary}
complicated_model_summary <- summary(complicated_morbidity_model)
head(as.data.frame(complicated_model_summary),-2)
```

```{r complicated-model-dens}
#density and trace plots of complicated model
mcmc_dens(complicated_morbidity_model)
mcmc_trace(complicated_morbidity_model)
```


# Race Model
```{r logistic-regression-model}
set.seed(84735)
race_morbidity_model <- stan_glm(
  no_mmorb ~ race + insurance + age + marital, 
  data = morbidity_data, family = binomial,
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2)
```

Next, we wanted to summarize our model.
```{r race-model-summary}
race_model_summary <- summary(race_morbidity_model)
head(as.data.frame(race_model_summary),-2)
```

```{r odds-of-mean}
#mean
exp(c(-0.49408245, 0.06471849 , 0.68447106)) #native american, asian, black
exp(c(-0.72164298)) #insurance
```

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, the odds that someone who is Native American experiences maternal morbidity is an average of 0.69 times the odds that someone who is white experiences morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, the odds that someone who is Asian or Pacific Islander experiences maternal morbidity is an average of 1.06 times the odds that someone who is white experiences morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, the odds that someone who is 
Black experiences maternal morbidity is an average of 1.98 times the odds that someone who is white experiences morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and race, the odds that someone with insurance experiences maternal morbidity is an average of 0.485 times the odds that someone without insurance experiences morbidity.

```{r odds-of-interval}
#credible intervals
exp(c(-1.2704155, 0.35641770)) #native american
exp(c(-0.4434041, 0.59677159)) #asian or pacific islander
exp(c(0.2830783, 1.09873140)) #black
exp(c(-1.5612151, 0.03870364)) #insurance
```

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, there is an 80% posterior probability that the odds that a Native American experiences maternal morbidity is between 0.28 and 1.42 times the odds that a white person experiences morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, there is an 80% posterior probability that the odds that an Asian person or Pacific Islander experiences maternal morbidity is between 0.64 and 1.81 times the odds that someone who is white experiences morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and insurance, there is an 80% posterior probability that the odds that a Black person experiences maternal morbidity is between 1.32 and 3 times the odds that a white person experiences morbidity.

Adjusting for age, marital status, and race, there is an 80% posterior probability that the odds that someone with insurance experiences maternal morbidity is between 0.21 and 1.03 times the odds that someone without insurance experiences morbidity.
